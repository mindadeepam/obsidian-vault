I have talked about implementing some processes to help meÌ› grow in my career [here](https://amusebouche.bearblog.dev/what-would-you-like-to-learn/). Here I want some concrete action items i can hold myself accountable too. 

But before that, lets reflect back:

> [These](https://amusebouche.bearblog.dev/touching-grass/) were my action items when I came back from diwali on 4/11/2024:
> 1. no regular smoking up
> 2. gym every day
> 3. no junk food (was eating daily ... probably due to pt 1). 
>    
> In the 13 days since, I managed to do 
> 1. 9/13
> 2. 7/13
> 3. 8/13
>    
> Thats a 61% score (avg of 8/13). Not sometginh to be proud of ig, but we'd do well to recall that we came here from a stagerringly low 0%. So thats gotta mean something good. 
> 
> The target for the next fortnight would be $>{75}\%$ so $\approx 11$ days.

# Now Lets plan ahead for our career

For today lets first list down some ideas. Remember to-
- *aim high*
- *do something cool*
- *small achievalble goals*


So some of the processes could be - 
1. write paper explanations/blogs: *meh*
2. implement papers: *again a little meh*
3. better way to get into papers and stuff is to reach out to research orgs / colleges and **get in academic research. this bumps profile a lot** reach out to AI4bharat & stuff..
4. *coool af*, **contribute to opensource**: *could be a **way to learn any topic** enough and then just contribute..* 
5. *required*, **strentghen core CS/ML/DL**: learn pytorch and stuff a little more follow some courses tutorials / advanced even... 
6. **read a lot**  [cs books + dl books + fundamentals the focus here + papers]
7. *required*, **maintain a portfolio: *what would u be proud to work on* + *increase surface area*** i think writing *articles* can work well here, just keep writing and try a blog or 2 keep ttrying till u imprive. topic can be anything. someday u'll be good enough to provide value. 
   > [!info] blogs must always be as deep as possible
   
8.  *required*, dsa
9. *required*, **apply, assess companies and oppurtunities**. This **guides long term vision and is very important**


Topic wise next sprints:

1. would love to build a decent web app with frontend backend doing something useful. anything that like 20-50 people could use. *this is to learn frontend backend simple webdev concepts and javascript*
2. deeper into deep leanring. **??** *optimization?* / 
	1. *torch inside out*: learning / implementing a deeplearning library can get us very close to hardware too.
3. implement stuff from basics, whatever u want to learn more:
	- wanna know pytorch in and out? write a blog on how it works. 
	- wanna learn RF, learn something till u can blog and provde some value. 
	- wanna know matrix algorithms from scratch? implement numpy or pytorch from scratch.

> [!quote] i seem to be more motivated by learning internals of CS / machines / libraries than doing "data-science"

4. lets list some ML/DL topics here:
   1. classic ML and basics. (better to solve problems in this domain thsn lesrn??)
   2. deep learning [cnn/rnn/attention] not valuable unless u go deep.
   3. DL library [this goes deep] implementation.
   4. small llms tinkering. [feel like im not there yet? dont know why]
   5. Reinforcement learning

## Types of DL companies and/or jobs

current: data science + software dev / basic python basic datascience

datascience heavy: statistics heavy / analytics comapnies..EY, tiger / finance?.. *seems boring*

product shipping, usually DL?: *exciting* / *growth* / smallai, sarvam,../ same skills can get me in big tech? *FAANG*

*FAANG*: dsa, dsa, dsa. fundamentals, research..
