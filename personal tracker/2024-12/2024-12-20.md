- revisiting **towers** today cant seem to crack.
  update: itgs actually a great question, after looking at the solution. ew need to use bisect to bring $n^2$ down to $n\log{n}$.
- revisiting allocating books. **binary search** is still tough for me. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-asked-binary-search-interview-questions/) (gfg article) you can find a collection of binary sesrch questions for practise. 
	- [aggresive cows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/aggressive-cows/0): like allocating-books, proved tough still I seem to overcomplicate things.... i discuss the standard binary search template [[binary search |here]]. 
	- [minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/1): since we are searching over a continuous range there are a few changes:
	  
	  ```python
		while e - s > 1e-6:  # 1. Use small epsilon for floating point comparison
			mid = (s + e) / 2
			if check_possible(arr, k, mid):
				e = mid      # 2. no +- 1 because we are not iterating over ints now 
			else:
				s = mid
		```
