- since i watch so many movies, can i make a movie recommender? [[#Project idea Movie recommender|here]] 






## Project idea: Movie recommender
- a simple site.. 
- genre wise / or some basic filters / get a list of movies.

### # MVP

- scrape movies!! and make a db:
	- title
	- year
	- cast
	- rating: google reviews and roger ebert rating showcased along with imdb and rotten tomatoes
- filtering based on year/actor/director...

### # Issue Blocking

- google reviews toh mil rhe hai but its dynamically loaded content which needs selenium and hence is not scalable. so a review data for movies released after 2000 seems a huge scraing job 
  $500*20 = 10000 movies$ 
  $10000*5 s = 50000 s = 833 mins = ~14 hrs$  
  possible still
