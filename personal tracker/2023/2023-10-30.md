## To do

## Note
- label encoding works, with logistic regression head toooooo, without multi-target stratergy!!!!
- for full model finetuning, we need to train body separately then the head separately (especially in case of diff head)! 
- diff head se probably label encoded data ke saath error nai nikal sakte
- 1000 opt steps take 3 mins = 330 steps per 60 sec = ~6 sec per step of 16 batches and 256 seq len 
- *embedding models try karo .....*
## Reminders
- 


## Training logs

1. training peft with contrastive, plus head and peft in clf finetuning

- difff head (fb trac en):
	 label encoded
	- .46872, 20 samples, 60 numiterations, 2 contrastive epochs, 20 clf epochs
	- .48, 30 samples, 60 iter, 3 contr epochs, 30 clf epochs
- non diff head( dairai)
- 29%
