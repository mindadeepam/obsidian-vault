## To do

- [ ] For PR maize/Code review of maize-quality:
	- [x] ~~Maize quality module ready.~~ ***(Predict-grains-general should be the only script)***
	- Match accuracies from prev code(predict-grains output should be same as predict-grains-genral).  [or predict-grain in new pipeline must match predict-grain-general in old pipeline]
- [x] For training: 
	- check pipeline/notebook 
	- fix distance and hyperparams hyper params (attribute_th=0.3) 
- [x] For img->training data: 
	- prepare scripts (notebook use karlo)

## Note
1. do better thresholding using box_prompting with SAM.
2. after 1. fix hyperparams on the data.
- [x] implement optimizations (see yesterday's [notes](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=personal%20tracker%2Fdaily%2F03-10-2023), i.e. use origin shiftitng plus small patchces)
- start training!!
- [x] **filter data from 4th October onwards**  (manually download karlo)
