# CAREER PLANS

**Do whatever the fuck you want but do stuff!!**

# Next Job

> *APPLY MORE! MUCH MORE*
## company

1. One jump up in a startup (not ML first): prepare for interviews. [[#Prepare for intreview|see here]] 
2. FAANG type shiz: 
	1. open source contributions
	2. [[#Prepare for intreview|interview prep]]
	3. if ML role then need papers.
## role

company specific more than role because roles vary a lot. So *apply apply*.
for now consider 2 opitons same as company.

current: data science + software dev / basic python basic datascience
datascience heavy: statistics heavy / analytics comapnies..EY, tiger / finance?.. *seems boring*
product shipping, usually DL?: *exciting* / *growth* / smallai, sarvam,../ same skills can get me in big tech? *FAANG*
*FAANG*: dsa, dsa, dsa. fundamentals, research..

## Prepare for intreview

- dsa
- apply, assess companies and oppurtunities. This guides long term vision and is very important
<br>

# Long term vision 

## MAKE shit! be a creator!: output

## Contribute to opensource: output 
could be a way to learn any topic enough and then just contribute.

## Maintain a portfolio: output
*what would u be proud to work on* + *increase surface area* i think writing *articles* can work well here, just keep writing and try a blog or 2 keep ttrying till u imprive. topic can be anything. someday u'll be good enough to provide value. 
   > blogs must always be as deep as possible. no matter how much u need to learn. it wont be out in a weekend or two dont worry, take your time.

## Keep learning: input
cs books + dl books + fundamentals the focus here + papers.
strentghen core CS/ML/DL learn pytorch and stuff a little more follow some courses tutorials / advanced even
#### Document your journey
this will help motivate learning.
## Get in academic research?
better way to get into papers and stuff is to reach out to research orgs / colleges and get in academic research. this bumps profile a lot reach out to AI4bharat & stuff..o

# Next Month Action Items

For next 1-2 months these will be my focus:

1. Have to begin with deep learning 102 and LLMs. 
   def a blog. how will u make it different??
   day 1: readupto and document attetnion is all u need.
   day 2: 
   
1. python backend course<span style="color:rgb(185, 231, 136)">
</span>
3. dsa everyday, apply on weekends.
