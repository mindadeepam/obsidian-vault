# Learning

1. ML/DS Basics.. theory.. (for interview)
2. DSA (for interview)
3. Deep Learning / or something more advanced than (1) and (2)
4. *whatever the fuck you want* (can be satisying 3 too)
	 Example:
	- implement stuff from basics, whatever u want to learn more:
	- wanna know pytorch in and out? write a blog on how it works. 
	- wanna learn RF, learn something till u can blog and provde some value. 
	- wanna know matrix algorithms from scratch? implement numpy or pytorch from scratch.

# Next Job

> *APPLY MORE! MUCH MORE*
## company

1. One jump up in a startup (not ML first): prepare for interviews. [[#Prepare for intreview|see here]] 
2. FAANG type shiz: 
	1. open source contributions
	2. [[#Prepare for intreview|interview prep]]
	3. if ML role then need papers.
## role

company specific more than role because roles vary a lot. So *apply apply*.
for now consider 2 opitons same as company.

current: data science + software dev / basic python basic datascience
datascience heavy: statistics heavy / analytics comapnies..EY, tiger / finance?.. *seems boring*
product shipping, usually DL?: *exciting* / *growth* / smallai, sarvam,../ same skills can get me in big tech? *FAANG*
*FAANG*: dsa, dsa, dsa. fundamentals, research..

# Prepare for intreview

- dsa
- apply, assess companies and oppurtunities. This guides long term vision and is very important

# Long term vision 

## MAKE shit! be a creator!


## Contribute to opensource 
could be a way to learn any topic enough and then just contribute.

## Maintain a portfolio
*what would u be proud to work on* + *increase surface area* i think writing *articles* can work well here, just keep writing and try a blog or 2 keep ttrying till u imprive. topic can be anything. someday u'll be good enough to provide value. 
   > blogs must always be as deep as possible. no matter how much u need to learn. it wont be out in a weekend or two dont worry, take your time.

## Keep learning

cs books + dl books + fundamentals the focus here + papers.
strentghen core CS/ML/DL learn pytorch and stuff a little more follow some courses tutorials / advanced even

## Get in academic research?
better way to get into papers and stuff is to reach out to research orgs / colleges and get in academic research. this bumps profile a lot reach out to AI4bharat & stuff..
# Next Month Action Items

For next 1-2 months these will be my focus:

1. optimization: 
   *input*
   can learn to optimize runtime of various models(cnns/1b llms/..) for same task performace, metrics wise. lot of scope to learn many things.
   *output*
   blog. can see it being a good one.
2. python backend course
3. dsa everyday and apply everyday.
4. want to do something outside of pure ml/dl. dont know what though!

Special mention (ye most prolly nai honge):
1. torch karne ka man hai for DL. but need to find something for which torch will just be a tool. 
2. Reinforcement learning
3. DL library [this goes deep] implementation: ive no real motive here i dont train models enough to want to learn this right now.
