I'm 3 days away from being 25 dude. Incidentally I should actually be 2000 kilometres away from where I am right now in Meghalaya. But that trip took a backseat no thanks to a couple of morons whose machoism and stupidity on 4th of Dec led to me having a fractured knee and a swollen fucking hip. But I might escape without a surgery if i manage to take good care of myself for 50 days. 

But hey its been 10 days and I've graduated to other important bs. I have learned that a man undergoes somewhat of a rebirth around 25-27 which changes his perspective in life. Well I'm still waiting on mine bc if someone's taking note. 

Other than this I'm again just penning down any and everything that is coming to mind but its kind of worrying that I dont have a consistent broader thing to journal about once or twice a month. 

The thing at the forefront of my thoughts is that my work has not being providing me satisfaction for over 6 months purely on basis of the quality of work and challenge, and this has probably been the only consistent theme in all my journals over the past couple months. I feel stagnated and am super lost, dont really know where to go from here. Whenver I see someone killing it in life, theres some part of me that quips, "What about u bro?". And I dont have an answer. I wont pretend to try and find solutions in this journal, far too many have gone by where no subsequent action took place. And I dont even think this is about the job switch (company switch), bcuz yeah I need to go somewherer that I find more challenging and interesting, but I guess I still have wuestions about this tech-ML thing even being my line of work so to speak. And maybe this comes from a postiion of priviledge but do I just wanna be that guy? climbing the corporate ladder and all? I dont think so man. Whenever I look at someine killing it online I think man I could do that cant I, standup or vlogging or music or whatever the hell it is. Maybe its my naivety and not understandging what it takes to reach the top of anything. Or maybe its a symptom of me not being actually interested in my field. 

Whats a brother to do man?

I thought about learning music production after having seedhe maut on loop for the past month, but man is starting things tough. Idk why therre is so much friction in me for learning new stuff, i tend to give up at the smallest hurdle I come across.
