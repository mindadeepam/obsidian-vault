# what are transactions?

Transactions in the context of databases are a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must exhibit four properties, commonly known as ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

### ACID Properties

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the transaction are completed successfully; if not, the transaction is aborted, and no operations are performed. It's all-or-nothing.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
3. **Isolation**: Ensures that the operations of one transaction are isolated from those of other transactions, preventing concurrent transactions from affecting each other.
4. **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

### Example of Transactions

Consider a banking application where you need to transfer money from one account to another. This operation involves two main steps:
1. Deduct the amount from the sender's account.
2. Add the amount to the recipient's account.

Both steps must succeed for the transaction to be valid. If one step fails (e.g., insufficient funds in the sender's account), the entire transaction should fail, and the database should remain unchanged.

### Implementing Transactions

In SQLAlchemy, you can manage transactions using both the Core and ORM approaches.

**Core SQLAlchemy:**
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, Column, Integer, String, exc

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
metadata = MetaData()

user_table = Table('user', metadata,
                   Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
                   Column('name', String),
                   Column('balance', Integer))

metadata.create_all(engine)

with engine.connect() as conn:
    trans = conn.begin()
    try:
        conn.execute(user_table.insert(), {'name': 'Alice', 'balance': 100})
        conn.execute(user_table.insert(), {'name': 'Bob', 'balance': 50})
        # Deduct from Alice
        conn.execute(user_table.update().where(user_table.c.name == 'Alice').values(balance=user_table.c.balance - 30))
        # Add to Bob
        conn.execute(user_table.update().where(user_table.c.name == 'Bob').values(balance=user_table.c.balance + 30))
        trans.commit()
    except exc.SQLAlchemyError:
        trans.rollback()
```

**ORM SQLAlchemy:**
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, exc

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'user'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    balance = Column(Integer)

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

try:
    alice = User(name='Alice', balance=100)
    bob = User(name='Bob', balance=50)
    session.add(alice)
    session.add(bob)
    session.commit()

    # Deduct from Alice
    alice.balance -= 30
    # Add to Bob
    bob.balance += 30

    session.commit()
except exc.SQLAlchemyError:
    session.rollback()
```

In both examples, the transaction ensures that both steps (deduction and addition) are completed successfully. If any part of the transaction fails, the database rolls back to its previous state, maintaining consistency and integrity.


# when to use transactions?

Not all interactions with a database need to be conducted as transactions, but there are several scenarios where using transactions is crucial to ensure data integrity and consistency. Understanding when to use transactions is important for both performance and reliability. Here are some guidelines:

### When to Use Transactions

1. **Multi-Step Operations**:
   - **Financial Transactions**: Transferring money between accounts, as described earlier.
   - **Order Processing**: Updating inventory, creating an order, and processing payment.
   - **Batch Updates**: Performing multiple related updates or inserts that must all succeed or fail together.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - **Complex Consistency Rules**: When operations must adhere to complex business rules and consistency constraints.
   - **Interdependent Updates**: When changes to one part of the data depend on changes to another part.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - **Recovery from Failures**: To ensure the system can revert to a consistent state in case of errors or failures.
   - **Ensuring Atomicity**: To make sure that either all changes within a transaction are applied, or none are.

4. **Concurrency Control**:
   - **Preventing Race Conditions**: When multiple processes or users might attempt to modify the same data simultaneously.
   - **Ensuring Isolation**: To ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

### When Not to Use Transactions

1. **Read-Only Operations**:
   - **Simple Queries**: Fetching data without the need for consistency guarantees.
   - **Reporting**: Running reports or analytics that do not modify the database.

2. **Single-Step Operations**:
   - **Simple Inserts/Updates**: When a single operation is sufficient, and no complex integrity rules are involved.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - **High-Volume Operations**: Transactions can introduce overhead; for some high-volume operations, it might be necessary to carefully manage when and how transactions are used.

### Examples

**Good Use of Transactions**:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData
from sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
metadata = MetaData()

user_table = Table('user', metadata,
                   Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
                   Column('name', String),
                   Column('balance', Integer))

metadata.create_all(engine)

# Example of a multi-step operation
with engine.connect() as conn:
    trans = conn.begin()
    try:
        conn.execute(user_table.insert(), {'name': 'Alice', 'balance': 100})
        conn.execute(user_table.insert(), {'name': 'Bob', 'balance': 50})
        # Deduct from Alice
        conn.execute(user_table.update().where(user_table.c.name == 'Alice').values(balance=user_table.c.balance - 30))
        # Add to Bob
        conn.execute(user_table.update().where(user_table.c.name == 'Bob').values(balance=user_table.c.balance + 30))
        trans.commit()
    except SQLAlchemyError:
        trans.rollback()
```

**Unnecessary Use of Transactions**:
```python
# Simple read-only operation
with engine.connect() as conn:
    result = conn.execute(user_table.select().where(user_table.c.name == 'Alice')).fetchall()
    for row in result:
        print(row)
```

### Conclusion

Use transactions for operations that involve multiple steps, require strict data integrity, or need to handle errors gracefully. For simple, read-only, or single-step operations, transactions are usually unnecessary. Balancing the use of transactions ensures both performance and data reliability.
