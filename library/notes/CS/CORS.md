# Never quite understood CORS explain with examples ..

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism built into web browsers to prevent unauthorized access to resources on a different domain (or origin) from where a web page is being served.

  

**What is an Origin?**

  

An **origin** is defined by:

1. **Protocol** (e.g., http, https)

2. **Domain** (e.g., example.com)

3. **Port** (e.g., 8080)

  

Two URLs have **different origins** if **any** of these differ. For example:

• https://example.com and http://example.com → **different origins** (protocols differ)

• https://example.com and https://api.example.com → **different origins** (domains differ)

• https://example.com:3000 and https://example.com → **different origins** (ports differ)

  

**Why Do We Need CORS?**

  

Browsers enforce the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)** for security:

• A web page can only make requests to the **same origin** from which it was served.

• This prevents malicious sites from accessing sensitive data from another site using the user’s credentials.

  

However, there are legitimate reasons to fetch resources from other origins (e.g., fetching data from an API hosted on a different domain). This is where **CORS** comes in.

  

**How Does CORS Work?**

  

CORS allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources. This is done using HTTP headers.

  

**Example 1: No CORS Issue**

  

1. A web page served from https://example.com fetches a resource from https://example.com/api/data.

2. Since the origin is the same, the browser allows the request.

  

**Example 2: CORS Issue**

  

1. A web page served from https://example.com tries to fetch a resource from https://anotherdomain.com/api/data.

2. The browser sends a **preflight request** to https://anotherdomain.com to check if this cross-origin request is allowed.

3. If https://anotherdomain.com doesn’t include the correct CORS headers in its response, the browser blocks the request.

  

**CORS Headers**

  

**1. Response Header: Access-Control-Allow-Origin**

  

This header specifies which origins can access the resource.

• Example:

  

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com

  

Only https://example.com can access this resource.

  

• Wildcard:

  

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

  

Any origin can access this resource.

  

**2. Preflight Request**

  

For some operations (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE or custom headers), browsers send a **preflight OPTIONS request** to check permissions before the actual request.

• Server Response:

  

Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS

Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com

  

This tells the browser which methods, headers, and origins are allowed.

  

**Examples in Action**

  

**Example 3: API with CORS Enabled**

  

1. Server (api.example.com) includes:

  

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.com

  

  

2. Web page from https://frontend.com requests data:

  

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')

  .then(response => response.json())

  .then(data => console.log(data))

  .catch(error => console.error('CORS error:', error));

  

  

3. If headers match, the browser allows the request. Otherwise, it blocks the request.

  

**Example 4: API without CORS Headers**

  

1. Server (api.example.com) does **not** include CORS headers.

2. Web page from https://frontend.com requests data.

3. The browser blocks the request and logs a CORS error:

  

Access to fetch at 'https://api.example.com/data' from origin 'https://frontend.com'

has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present.

  

**Common Issues**

  

1. **CORS is a browser-enforced policy**: It doesn’t apply to backend-to-backend communication (e.g., using curl or Postman).

2. **Wildcards (*****) and Credentials**: If a request includes credentials (cookies or HTTP authentication), Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * **cannot** be used. Instead, specify the exact origin.

3. **Preflight Requests Not Handled**: If the server doesn’t respond correctly to the preflight OPTIONS request, the browser blocks the actual request.

  

**Quick Analogy**

  

Think of CORS as a bouncer at a club:

• Your web page (client) is the visitor.

• The API (server) is the club.

• The bouncer (browser) checks the guest list (CORS headers). If the visitor’s name (origin) isn’t on the list, they’re not allowed in.

  

Let me know if you want more details on implementation or debugging!

By default, **CORS is not enabled on servers**, meaning:

1. **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block any cross-origin requests unless the server explicitly allows them via CORS headers.

2. **No CORS Headers by Default**: If a server doesn’t include CORS headers in its response, any request from a different origin will fail in the browser with an error like:

  

Access to fetch at 'https://api.example.com/resource' from origin 'https://frontend.com' 

has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present.

  

  

  

In summary:

• **Default behavior in browsers**: Cross-origin requests are denied.

• **Default behavior on servers**: Servers typically do not send CORS headers unless explicitly configured.
