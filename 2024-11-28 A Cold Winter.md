As we near the end of November, cold is at its peak. Seedhe Maut on loop. Just had a grwat birthday weekend with my baby girl at [Tijara resort](https://www.neemranahotels.com/tijara-fort-palace-alwar-rajasthan/) near Rajasthan. It was the one of the best weekends of my life. ("The best weekends of my life" is an idea?)

I turn to writing to help me sortmy thoughts out. Going to the gym helps me feel good about myself, not in a cosmetic way, but there is something about tiring your body that just helps you have a better day. And yappers can yap about its benefits all day long. But after 3 weeks or so I have, would you fucking beleive it, gained weight. its under a kg but junk food certainly has been something I cant seem to get rid of. I have not worked on either of my 2 past journals and I just seem to be doing the talking, not the walking. 

I need to either start applying or learning like crazy something has to happen right now for me to get better work.
