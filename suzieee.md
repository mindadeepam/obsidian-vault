<details><summary>don't feed packet wet food/dry food</summary>
I’m a fully trained pet and animal nutritionist. When it comes to your vet recommended diets such as royal canin and hills etc, vs whiskers and Felix type foods I wouldn’t recommend either. Both types of foods are relatively low quality. Cats are obligate carnivores meaning that their diet should consist of a high meat food. Unfortunately, Felix/ whiskers/ gourmet only contain around 4% meat and the other ingredients consist of low quality fillers such as cereals. Royal canin is relatively similar with low meat and it is very filler heavy. Both foods contain high amounts of sugar and salt (which is why most cats eat it) however this can cause issues like diabetics and pancreatitis. Hills is a little bit better however it is still low on the quality scale. With cats you want to aim for a high meat diet. Brands like **Canagan, nature’s menu, farmina n&d** and more are all examples of high meat and low or even gran free diets. Feeding these kinds of diets reduces the risk of health issues in later life. Also it saves you ALOT of money. The higher the meat content with both cat and dog foods mean you feed less, which inevitably saves you money. The reason gets recommend royal canin, hills, pro plan etc is unfortunately Becouse most vets are either sponsored or owned by either Mars or nestle. Mars and nestle are who own royal canin, hills, pro plan etc. As a result these companies and the vets get commission from recommending these foods. Vets are also not nutrition trained and are only trained on the brands of foods they stock, like royal canin. As a result they recommend foods that aren’t the best for the animals diet. Hope this helps :)

- bread/roti : cats make energy from protein. not from carbs. so no use giving bread/roti.



## Nutirents it needs

Here are essential nutrients and requirements for cats (verified through veterinary sources like AAFCO, AVMA, and Merck Veterinary Manual):

### 1. Proteins & Amino Acids ☑️
  - Arginine: Critical for ammonia detoxification (found in meat/fish)
  - Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine: Essential amino acids (animal protein sources)

  Chicken contains all but 3 amino acids from 11 (See below). The remaining 3 are present in <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: #734d26; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 
  <details>
  <summary>Amino acids in comprehensive detail</summary>

  A cat’s body can make many of the amino acids they need (nonessential amino acids) from other amino acids, but there are [11 essential amino acids for cats](https://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/pet-food-ingredient-and-label-guide#Amino%20Acids) that must be supplied in a cat’s diet:

  1.  Arginine
  2.  Histidine
  3.  Isoleucine
  4.  Leucine
  5.  Lysine
  6.  Methionine
  7.  Phenylalanine
  8.  Taurine
  9.  Threonine
  10. Tryptophan
  11. Valine

  Chicken contains all but taurine, methionine, and tryptophan. Here are some foods that you can add to your cat's diet to provide these:

  *   **Taurine:**
      *   Shellfish (clams, mussels, scallops)
      *   Dark meat chicken and turkey
      *   Beef liver
      *   Lamb
      *   Fish (tuna, salmon, sardines)
  *   **Methionine:**
      *   Eggs
      *   Fish (tuna, salmon, sardines)
      *   Turkey
      *   Beef
      *   Pork
      *   Dairy products (cheese, yogurt)
  *   **Tryptophan:**
      *   Turkey
      *   Chicken
      *   Fish (tuna, salmon)
      *   Eggs
      *   Dairy products (milk, cheese)
  </details>

### 2. Vitamins

  - Vitamin A: Preformed from animal sources (liver, fish oils)
  - Vitamin D: From animal tissues (cats can’t synthesize enough from sunlight) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 
  - Vitamin E: Antioxidant (found in fish, eggs) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 
  - Vitamin B12: Nerve/blood health (meat, organs) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span>  

### 3. Minerals ☑️
   - Calcium & Phosphorus: Bone health (1:1 to 2:1 ratio; found in bone meal, small fish) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 
   - Magnesium: Muscle/nerve function (meat, fish) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 
   - Zinc: Immune/skin health (organ meats, poultry) <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: pink; border-radius: 4px;"></span> 

### 4. Fats
   - Arachidonic Acid: Essential fatty acid (animal fats, fish oil)
   - Omega-3/6: Skin/coat health (salmon, sardines)

## Others things

- Who wants one food for life? Have a **variety of food** for cat.
- Cats are very scent afftected. **Keep cats bed/litterbox/water-bowl/food-bowl separate** from each other. even the food and water bowl as food smell might not want it to drink water.
- Cat whiskers are a diff think not like moustaches. they need their space. have **larger/wider food bowls** or use open plates so that his whiskers dont get cramped/bent.
- dont oversimulate the cat. save treats for when nailclipping/meds.
- visit vet monthly?
